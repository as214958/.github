# Welcome to as214958 👋

This organization provides shared development infrastructure for collaborative projects.

## 🚀 Shared Resources

### Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Runner

We maintain a shared self-hosted runner available to all repositories in this organization. This allows for:
- Custom build environments
- Potentially faster execution times
- Access to specialized hardware or software

## 📚 Getting Started

To use our shared infrastructure:

1. Create or fork a repository within this organization
2. Add GitHub Actions workflows that use `runs-on: self-hosted`
3. Check out our [workflow templates](https://github.com/as214958/.github) for examples

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a collaborative space. Please be considerate of shared resources and follow best practices when using the self-hosted runner.

## 📫 Contact
